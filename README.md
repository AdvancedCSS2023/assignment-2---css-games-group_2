## What the project does

This project is the "Mouse Game". The Mouse Game player is in a role of a mouse that needs to get to the cheese on the opposite side. Once the mouse is placed in the visible field of gray color, the player needs to wait until the front gate will be opened. From this moment the active game begins; the mouse must pass through a series of obstacles such as mousetraps and cats. Moreover, the mouse cannot go beyond the gates set for all objects. If the mouse is caught into a mousetrap or collides with a cat, it dies and the game is over; the game window closes in red with the inscription "You lost". You can click the "TRY AGAIN" button to play again. If the player reached the cheese, they will see the inscription "You win" and they can press the button "PLAY AGAIN" to play again.

## Why the project is useful

Such a game can be interesting for children who are beginning to understand and learn about their world. The mouse game develops and stimulates imagination, thinking, and hand motility. Manipulation with a computer mouse or touchpad develops hand motility well. Also, the game implements a true idea about the animal world (the relationship between cats and mice) and also shows what a mousetrap is and its danger (for children too, so a child will not touch it if he sees it somewhere). However, the "Mouse Game" is also a good solution for adults to take a break from difficult and stressful work.

## How users can get started with the project

To start the game, the user must open the game and set the mouse in the field of view (gray field) as the "mouse" player and wait until the front gate opens and the game starts.

## Where users can get help with your project

Users can get help with our project through comprehensive documentation that explains how to use the project, how it works, and any potential issues they may encounter. This documentation will be easily accessible and well-organized, so users can quickly find the information they need.

In addition, we will provide an email address where users can contact us directly for support. We will make sure to respond to emails promptly and provide helpful solutions to any issues they may be experiencing. This email support can provide users with a direct and personal way to get help with our project.

## Which technology is used

The technology used in this case is a combination of HTML, SCSS and BEM. HTML is used for the markup and structure of the web page. SCSS is a preprocessor for CSS that allows for more efficient and organized CSS code. BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a naming convention used to make CSS classes more descriptive and easier to understand. In this case, we are using an extention called live sass compiler to compile SCSS to CSS. Together, these technologies allow for the creation of a well-structured and maintainable web page.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project


There are three people working on the project (Edgar, Christopher and Snizhana). Therefore, all three of us are responsible for maintaining and contributing to the project. To ensure that all tasks are being taken care of and progress is being made, it's essential to establish clear roles and responsibilities among team members. We will also include this information in our project documentation, so users are aware of who to contact for support or to contribute to the project.
