## What the project does

This project is the "Mouse Game". The Mouse Game player is in a role of a mouse that needs to get to the cheese on the opposite side. Once the mouse is placed in the visible field of gray color, the player needs to wait until the front gate will be opened. From this moment the active game begins; the mouse must pass through a series of obstacles such as mousetraps and cats. Moreover, the mouse cannot go beyond the gates set for all objects. If the mouse is caught into a mousetrap or collides with a cat, it dies and the game is over; the game window closes in red with the inscription "You lost". You can click the "TRY AGAIN" button to play again. If the player reached the cheese, they will see the inscription "You win" and they can press the button "PLAY AGAIN" to play again.
