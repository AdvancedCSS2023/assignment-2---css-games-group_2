## What the project does

This project is the "Mouse Game". The Mouse Game player is in a role of a mouse that needs to get to the cheese on the opposite side. Once the mouse is placed in the pipe opening of gray color, the player needs to wait until the inside of the pipe will be opened. From this moment the active game begins; the mouse must pass through a series of obstacles such as mousetraps and cats. Moreover, the mouse cannot go beyond the gates set for all objects. If the mouse is caught into a mousetrap or collides with a cat, it dies and the game is over; the game window closes in red with the inscription "You lost". You can click the "TRY AGAIN" button to play again. If the player reached the cheese, they will see the inscription "You win" and they can press the button "PLAY AGAIN" to play again.

## Why the project is useful

Such a game can be interesting for children who are beginning to understand and learn about their world. The mouse game develops and stimulates imagination, thinking, and hand motility. Manipulation with a computer mouse or touchpad develops hand motility well. Also, the game implements a true idea about the animal world (the relationship between cats and mice) and also shows what a mousetrap is and its danger (for children too, so a child will not touch it if he sees it somewhere). However, the "Mouse Game" is also a good solution for adults to take a break from difficult and stressful work.

## How users can get started with the project

First, the user should read the user documentation (this README file) with all instructions about the "Mouse Game"&. To start the game, the user must open the game and set the mouse in the pipe opening as the "mouse" player and wait until the inside of the pipe becomes visible for the user. Then the game starts.

## Where users can get help with your project

We understand that using a new project can sometimes be overwhelming, which is why we offer several resources to help you navigate and troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.

First and foremost, our comprehensive documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to use our project to prevent any misunderstanding. We've designed our documentation to be easily accessible and well-organized, so you can quickly find the information you need.

If you need further assistance, we offer email support where you can contact us directly with any questions or concerns. We are dedicated to provide prompt and helpful solutions to any issues you may be experiencing.

## Which technology is used

Our project relies on several technologies to deliver a seamless user experience. One of the core technologies we use is HTML, which is used for the markup and structure of the page. HTML provides a solid foundation for the web page, allowing us to structure and organize content in a logical and intuitive manner.

We also utilize SCSS, a preprocessor for CSS that allows for more efficient and organized code. SCSS extends the functionality of CSS, making it easier to write complex styles and maintain consistency across the entire web page. By using SCSS, we are able to write cleaner, more modular code that is easier to read and maintain.

To further enhance our development process, we employ BEM (Block, Element, Modifier), a naming convention that makes CSS classes more descriptive and easier to understand. BEM provides a clear and consistent way of naming and organizing CSS classes, making it easier to create and manage complex styles across the entire web page.

Finally, we use Live Sass Compiler, an extension that enables us to compile our SCSS code into CSS in real-time. This allows us to make changes to our SCSS code and see the results immediately, without the need for manual compilation. Live Sass Compiler streamlines our development process, enabling us to work more efficiently and productively.

By using these technologies in combination, we are able to deliver a web page that is well-structured, maintainable, and highly functional.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project

There are three people working on the project (Edgar, Christopher and Snizhana). Therefore, all three of us are responsible for maintaining and contributing to the project. To ensure that all tasks are being taken care of and progress is being made, it's essential to establish clear roles and responsibilities among team members. We will also include this information in our project documentation, so users are aware of who to contact for support or to contribute to the project.
